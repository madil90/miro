    bug fixes:
    * parse.y:151: fixed bug (creating TriangleMesh instead of Triangle)
    * ray.h:36: fixed const bug with Material pointer
    * scene.h:25: made Trace function const
    * triangleMesh.cpp:57: fixed bug, not setting material
    * triangleMeshLoad.cpp:204: fixed bug, normal flipped

    new features:
    * bspTree.h: added a BSPTree class
    * scene.[h|cpp]: replaced object list with a single BSPTree.
    * scene.h: changed AddObject to just call the BSPTree's AddObject
    * object.h,triangleMesh.[h|cpp]: modified the Refine function so it will
      work easier with BSP trees.
    * parse.y: for instancing, specifying a named mesh creates a BSPTree for
      just that mesh, names the BSPTree, and adds the BSP tree into the scene
